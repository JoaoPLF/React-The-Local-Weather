# React
**The Local Weather**

* This project shows weather data for the location typed into the input
* It is possible to save locations to show them on the Home page
* This project was done in Vue and I adapted it to React. You can find the original project at: https://github.com/johnkomarnicki/net_ninja_vue_3_weather_app
